![screenshot](/Assets/images/project-shoot1.png)

This project is the final in the Microverse HTML & CSS module - CAPSTONE. It's a real-world-like project, built with business specifications. The project for the HTML & CSS Capstone Project is based on an online shop for electronics. The given design of the website should be followed, but the content is personalized. 
- Project build for 3 screen sizes, small up to 576px wide, tablet size up to 768px and bigger screen sizes more than 768px.
- Bootstrap is used for responsive layout and JS actions.
- I choose Beauty Products collectibles for my e-store page, as it is a very popular segment of business with millions of dollars in turnover and costs of items reaching thousands per separate one. 
- The page has a responsive navbar menu collapsing by changing screen size from large to smaller, SEARCH bar leads to the search results page. 
- Page layout changes accordingly to the viewer's screen size to nicely fit the content.
- There are two pages available for displaying: the main page (search page) and the search results page. Switch between them by clicking the search button on the main page, and HOME anywhere on the search results page.
- Bootstrap snippets used for dropdown menus and form checkboxes.
- Just one JS function used for smooth scrolling.
